Invitation to FPiV'05

Dear Rama, 

I was my nice seeing you at CVPR'04.

Knowing that this might be of interest to you, it is my pleasure to invite you to join the Program Committee for the 
Second Workshop on  Face Processing in Video (FPiV'05) to be held jointly with AI/GI/CRV'2005, 
in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada May 9-12, 2005.

This would require from your part to review 3-4 papers which you could do either yourself or with the help of your colleagues.

Please let me know whether you are interested and whether your other commitments allow you to do this.

With deadlines approaching, fast response would be appreciated.

You and your colleagues are also very welcome to submit a paper for this workshop.

The tentative Call for Papers is appended below.

Look forward to hearing from you.
And best wishes
Dmitry
