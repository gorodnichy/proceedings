Following the rapid development of the video-based technologies and the success 
of the First Workshop on Face Processing in Video (FPiV'04) which was held in 
Washington, DC, jointly with CVPR'04, the Second Workshop on Face Processing in 
Video (FPiV'05) will be held in 2005 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. This 
time it will be held under the umbrella of CRV'2005 - the Canadian Conference on 
Computer & Robot Vision (formerly Vision Interface), which is the oldest 
international conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition annually 
held in Canada.  

As many of its predecessors, CRV'05 will be held jointly with AI'05 and GI'05: 
(Canadian conferences on Artificial Intelligence / Graphics Interface).  
The FPiV'05 workshop attendees will have therefore opportunity to attend all 
three conferences. 

Aims:
=====
The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for scientists from different 
backgrounds: biological vision, computer vision, pattern recognition, machine 
learning, computer-human interaction - to share their experiences and discuss 
the problems in the area of Face Processing in Video, and, as a result, to 
produce a collection of high-quality papers addressing these problems.

NB: As in the past, the focus of the workshop is dealing with video data, 
i.e. with data coming from video footage, rather than data coming from 
photo-cameras or laser scanners.

Topics:
=======
The suggested research areas are listed below (from theory-driven to 
application-driven one). Other topics dealing with the face in video scenario 
are also welcome.

?	neurobiological and neuro-computational approaches to visual perception 
and recognition
?	synergy between biological and computer vision
?	face segmentation and detection in video
?	face tracking and multiple faces tracking
?	face memorization, classification recognition from video
?	facial biometrics and face modeling, 3d face models
?	facial features for tracking and recognition
?	face representation, canonical face models, face in video databases 
?	face synthesis, mimicking and animation 
?	facial expression recognition and classification, and representation
?	fusing different modalities of video information (motion, colour, 
intensity)
?	performance evaluation for face in video problems
?	face detection/tracking/recognition in multi-camera setups including 
stereo
?	face detection/tracking/recognition in panoramic video
?	combining video and audio for speaker face detection/tracking/recognition
?	face-based multi-media, games, and computer-human interaction 
?	perceptual face-controlled interfaces
?	face processing for video-conferencing
?	face processing for avatars and computer-generated communication programs
?	face processing for immersive and collaborative environments
?	face processing for industry for disabled 
?	face processing for augmented and virtualized reality
?	face processing for security and surveillance 
?	face processing for encoding and annotating video 

Workshop proceedings: 
=====================  
The papers accepted for the workshop will be published by IEEE as part of the 
CRV'05 Proceedings and will be archived into the IEEE digital libraries.  


Submission and reviewing procedure:  
===================================
Papers should be full-size and complete, eight double-column pages maximum. They 
should not include any information that would indicate the author's identity 
(references to authors' previous work should be left blank).  

Papers should be formatted using the IEEE paper submission guidelines described 
in the Author Instructions page and submitted by email as PDF file (1.5Mb 
maximum) to the Program Chair (mailto:fpiv05ATvisioninterface.net, replace "AT" 
with "@"). 

Reviewing will be blind. Each paper will be reviewed by at least three Program 
Committee members. The goal is to have as vigorous and fair reviewing of all 
papers as possible.


Program Chairs: 
==============
Dmitry O. Gorodnichy, IIT-ITI, NRC-CNRC, Canada
Email: fpiv05ATvisioninterface.net (replace "AT" with "@")

Aleix M. Martinez, Ohio State U., USA
Email: fpiv05.chairATvisioninterface.net (replace "AT" with "@")


Confirmed Program Committee members:

Simon Baker, RI, CMU, USA
Marian S. Barlett, I. for Neural Computation, UCSB, USA
Rama Chellappa, UMD, USA
Roberto Cipolla, U. of Cambridge, UK
Ralf Gross, CMU, USA
Laurent Itti, U. of Southern California, USA

Registration and attendance: 
============================
- Participation in the FPiV'05 workshop without submitting a paper is welcomed. 
- For a single registration fee, the workshop participants will also be able to 
attend the joint conferences.
- Conversely, the FPiV'05 Workshop is open to all AI/GI/CRV'05 attendees.


Venue:
======
Vancouver island, where the city of Victoria is situated, is one of the most 
spectacular places in Canada, while Victoria, one of the oldest cities in 
Canada, is considered to be one of the Canadian gems. The workshop and joint 
conferences will be held on campus of the University of Victoria.
